    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>I am a young creative with an enormous passion for photography looking to enhance my skills and at the same time keep you entertained and hopefully plant a seed of thought, through my work, whose interpretation will entirely lie in your hands as my audience.

          My photography, occasionally spontaneous, is inspired to inspire others like minded, as well as my audience. My inspiration is sourced from nature.
          
          Photography, mine as well as others, creates a sense of inner peace which I use as a platform to cultivate interests, inspire thoughts and varied interpretation to my audience through my photography.
          
          Ultimately, I aim to sharpen my skills, be creative in my approach and earn a livelihood from my aspired profession.</p>
    <h3>Projects I've done and intend to do</h3>
